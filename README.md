- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @noob-dev. I work as a Software Engineer based in New Zealand.
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in meeting some other fellow noob developers who are willing to learn some new technologies.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently experimenting with a few things at the moment. This repo is one of the ways to hold myself accountable to code everyday.
